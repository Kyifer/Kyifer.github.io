                <h2>Community Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 -mt-4">Version 1.1</p>

                <h4>Welcome to BeSocia!</h4>

                <p>This Code of Conduct is more than just a set of rules; it's a shared commitment to our core values and a guide for how we interact with one another. By setting clear expectations, we empower every member and our dedicated volunteer team to maintain an environment that celebrates diversity and fosters trust. Your well-being is our highest priority, and these guidelines ensure that all interactions, whether online or face-to-face, are supportive and kind.</p>

                <h4>Confidentiality:</h4>
                <p>Your identity will be kept strictly confidential and will only be shared with the small, designated leadership team responsible for handling the report.

                <h4>Immediate Danger:</h4>
                <p>If someone is in immediate danger or you suspect illegal activity, call 999 (emergency services) immediately, then report to the Community Lead.</p>
                <h4>Mental Health Concerns:</h4>
                <p>If a member expresses severe mental health distress or suicidal ideation, listen empathetically and immediately report to the Community Lead. We can signpost to professional helplines like Samaritans (116 123) or Shout (text 85258).</p>

                <h3>V. Our Commitment to Fairness & Safety</h3>
                <p>BeSocia is committed to fair, transparent, and consistent enforcement of this Code of Conduct. All reports will be promptly reviewed and thoroughly investigated by the leadership team.</p>
                <h4>Our Moderation Process is to ensure fairness and consistency, while our leadership team follows a transparent three-strike process for most violations:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Strike:</strong> A private, informal warning to address the issue and clarify expectations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Strike:</strong> A formal written warning outlining the violation and the potential consequences of further breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Strike:</strong> Permanent removal from the BeSocia community, including all online platforms and future events.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note that severe violations (such as threats, harassment, or illegal activities) will result in immediate removal without warning, at the sole discretion of the leadership team.</p>
                <h4>Confidential Moderation Log & Data Retention</h4>
                <p>As part of this process, our leadership team maintains a confidential, internal moderation log. This log includes the member's name (as provided upon joining), their Discord User ID, and details of any violations of the Code of Conduct.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is processed under the "Legitimate Interest" of protecting the safety and well-being of our community, upholding our Code of Conduct, and ensuring our enforcement actions are consistent and fair.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> The log is strictly confidential and accessible only to authorised leadership members for moderation purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Records of moderation actions will be held for a period of 12 months following the last recorded incident. This retention period allows us to identify patterns of behaviour over time while respecting member privacy. After this period, the specific log entry will be anonymised or deleted.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>No Retaliation:</h4>
                <p>Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate disciplinary action.</p>

                <h3>VI. Review and Updates</h3>
                <p>This Code of Conduct is a living document. BeSocia is committed to regularly reviewing and updating these guidelines to ensure they remain relevant and effective. We welcome feedback on this document via our designated feedback channels.</p>
